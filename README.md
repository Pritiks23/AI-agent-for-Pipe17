Pipe17 Gemini AI Agent Demo

Welcome to the **Pipe17 Gemini AI Agent Demo**! This is a simple, visually engaging web interface to showcase how **Google Gemini** can act as an AI agent for operational tasks, like checking order status or suggesting restocks. Perfect for demos and interviews.  

---

## 🔹 Live Demo

You can view and interact with the demo here:

[**Pipe17 Gemini AI Agent on GitHub Pages**](https://pritiks23.github.io/AI-agent-for-Pipe17/)  


---

##  Features

- **Single-file HTML** with sleek black-and-cyan design  
- **Ask questions** to the Gemini AI agent in real-time  
- **Displays AI responses** in a glowing output box  
- **Supports API key input** so you can use your own Google Gemini key  
- **Error handling** for invalid keys or no response  

---

##  How It Works

1. Open the GitHub Pages link.  
2. Enter your **Google Gemini API key** in the input box.  
3. Type your question in the textarea.  
4. Click **Ask Gemini**.  
5. The AI response will appear in the box below.  

> Note: The current demo **does not pull real Pipe17 data**. Gemini generates **plausible AI responses** for demonstration purposes. To integrate live data, you can connect an API function to fetch real orders or inventory.

##  Example Questions

- “What’s the status of order PO-20017?”  
- “Which SKUs are below their reorder point?”  
- “Create a support ticket for PO-20018 about delivery delay.”  
- “Summarize today’s operational issues.”  

---

##  How to Deploy

1. Create a GitHub repository and add this `index.html`.  
2. Go to **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Deploy from branch** (main / root).  
3. Open your GitHub Pages URL to interact with the demo.  
4. Paste your **Google Gemini API key** and start asking questions.  

---

## ⚠Notes

- Responses are **AI-generated** using Google Gemini.  
- Accuracy depends on the model’s knowledge; it may **hallucinate** answers.  
- For **real-world usage**, connect a live database or API for actual order data.
